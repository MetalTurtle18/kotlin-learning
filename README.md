# Kotlin Learning
In this repository I will document my Kotlin learning process as I read through [*Kotlin in Action*, by Dmitry Jemerov and Svetlana Isakova](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action).

I will try to comment my code and organize it well. I will also try to create README files in each chapter directory to explain which Kotlin files are for which parts of the book. Please make a PR if you find anything to add, modify, or remove.

## Contents:
*There is no chapter one in this repository because it is just background information about the Kotlin language.*
* Chapter 2: [Kotlin basics](https://github.com/MetalTurtle18/kotlin-learning/tree/main/src/main/kotlin/chapter2)
  * 2.1: Basic elements: functions and variables | [`BasicElements.kt`](https://github.com/MetalTurtle18/kotlin-learning/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/chapter2/BasicElements.kt)
